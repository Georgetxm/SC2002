# Updates
Cams.java is the one with the main(), I've got some stuff in there just for testing.

## Major Changes
1. Action and QueryMenu instances -> Action and QueryMenu child classes
Since you cannot pass in methods as parameters, different instances of the same class will all have the same methods.
This means that .run() will have to be the same for all instances of the same class
So if each Action and QueryMenu call different controller functions, they will have to be their own class
The package camsAction houses these child classes

2. Permissions object -> EnumSet of permission enums
If permissions are a set, we can use .contains() to check whether the user has the required perms.
Users will only need to store perms they have, so it will reduce clutter of Perm = false stuff.
Sets support union, so can easily grant perms
Perms being enum means we can restrict what the perms are

3. CampAspects.java, the core package, and the CampController interface
These are just to ensure my code can compile, cos it will error if these are missing.
Please edit them freely as you want, idrc how they are done.
The only part that directly interfaces with my code is CampController.java
You can replace the current implementation (i.e. the rest) freely with whatever
Honestly I think the current implementation is kinda bad so do fix it up.


# ToDo
## Awaits
1. doSubmitSuggestion and doEditSuggestion awaiting CampInfo confirmation
2. Action classes inheritance testing awaits methods in controllers
## Jih How
1. Implement all action classes
2. Start on static and query menus

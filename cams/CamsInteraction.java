 * Static class to hold static menu choices and static user menus used in the CAMS app.
 * Each choice a menu can provide is represented by a MenuChoice object.
 * Selecting that choice will call an Interaction, which will either be a second menu, or will interact with the entity classes via a controller.
 * The objective of these multilevel menus is to inform the user and figure out his exact intention.
 * Once we know what the user exactly intends to do we can execute the relevant commands (e.g. add user A to camp B), prompting the user for parameters if needed.
 * Not all menus have their choices predefined, but those that do are initialised at compile time in this class

 * @see MenuChoice
